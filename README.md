# scheduleApp
Telegram bot that keeps track of your schedule

To start, go to the telebot folder and run npm start to initiate the app.

The app runs from a telegram bot and uses firestore as a database. You would be able to add, edit and retrieve events from the telegram bot.

In the my-app folder, I've created a mobile app that uses expo with react-native that provides a platform for adding and editing events to the firestore database. 
However, it is not updated but you can refer to it as a skeleton for a mobile app.
